# Constitution Update Phase2

## PROMPT_TEXT

Update the project constitution at .specify/memory/constitution.md to reflect Phase II requirements instead of Phase I. Change from a CLI-based Todo application to a Full-Stack Web Application with Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database, and Better Auth authentication. Update all core principles, technology stack, feature requirements, API contracts, authentication flow, data model, monorepo structure, scope boundaries, specification rules, implementation rules, quality standards, and success criteria to align with Phase II Full-Stack Web Application objectives.
